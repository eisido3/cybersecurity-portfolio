# Evan Isidoro | Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! I'm an aspiring SOC analyst with over two years of experience in IT support and growing hands-on exposure in cybersecurity. This portfolio highlights my technical capabilities, threat analysis skills, and understanding of real-world cyber defense tactics.

Each folder in this repo contains a different area of focus. I've included log analysis, threat assessments and playbook development in order to showcase my technical and written communication strengths.
